        <h2>Beginner Tips</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <span>Control the center of the board:</span>
            <ul>
              <li>Move pawns to occupy the center squares (d4, d5, e4, e5) as early as possible.</li>
              <li>Control the center with your pieces (knights and bishops) and don't leave them on the edges of the board.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Controlling the center of the board gives you more space to move your pieces and puts pressure on your opponent's position. It also gives your
              pieces more mobility and makes it easier to launch an attack.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Develop your pieces:</span>
            <ul>
              <li>Bring your knights and bishops out to active squares.</li>
              <li>Don't move the same piece twice in the opening, unless it's necessary to avoid a threat or to develop a piece.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Developing your pieces quickly allows you to control more of the board and create threats against your opponent's position. It also makes it
              easier to castle your king and connect your rooks.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Protect your king:</span>
            <ul>
              <li>Castle your king to a safe position behind a wall of pawns.</li>
              <li>Avoid leaving your king in the center of the board, where it can be attacked by enemy pieces.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Protecting your king is essential to avoiding a checkmate and winning the game. Castling early also helps to connect your rooks and improve your
              position.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Castle early:</span>
            <ul>
              <li>Castle your king to safety as soon as possible, usually on move 6-8.</li>
              <li>Don't delay castling for too long, as it can leave your king vulnerable to attack.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Castling is an important part of the opening strategy, as it allows you to connect your rooks and protect your king. It also puts your king in a
              safer position behind a wall of pawns.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Don't move the same piece twice:</span>
            <ul>
              <li>Try to develop all your pieces before moving the same piece twice.</li>
              <li>Only move the same piece twice if it's necessary to avoid a threat or to improve its position.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Moving the same piece twice in the opening can waste time and delay your development. It also allows your opponent to gain an advantage by
              developing their pieces and controlling more of the board.
