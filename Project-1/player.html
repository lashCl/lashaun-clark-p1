        <p>Magnus Carlsen, the Norwegian chess prodigy, is widely considered as one of the greatest chess players to ever grace the board.</p>
        <p>
          With a series of championship titles to his name, including the prestigious World Chess Championship, World Rapid Chess Championship, and World Blitz
          Chess Championship, Carlsen has cemented his position as a true icon in the world of chess. Since July 2011, he has been unbeatable, holding the No. 1
          spot in the FIDE world chess rankings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Carlsen's records speak volumes about his greatness, as he holds the records for the highest peak rating and longest unbeaten streak at the elite
          level in classical chess. His unpredictable and universal playing style, coupled with his ability to leverage a variety of openings, keeps his
          opponents on their toes, making him a formidable force on the board.

          As a Russian chess grandmaster, Ian Nepomniachtchi has dominated the chess world, earning himself several titles and championships, including the
          Russian Superfinal and European Individual titles.
        </p>
        <p>
          His impressive performance has earned him the right to challenge for the World Chess Championship title not once, but twice, after qualifying and
          winning two Candidates tournaments in a row. Although he ultimately lost his challenge to the defending champion Magnus Carlsen in 2021,
          Nepomniachtchi's legacy remains unparalleled as he continues to hold the No. 2 spot in classical chess.

          both the 2019 Grand Chess Tour and the 2019 Sinquefield Cup, where he beat Magnus Carlsen in a playoff, a feat not accomplished since 2007. Ding has
          made history as the first Chinese player to surpass the 2800 Elo mark on the FIDE world rankings and to play in a Candidates Tournament.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had also previously set a new record for the longest unbeaten streak in top-level chess history, going 100 games undefeated from August 2017 to
          November 2018 before Magnus Carlsen beat the streak in 2019. Currently, he ranks No. 3 in classical chess and is set to challenge in the upcoming
          World Chess Championship 2023.

          Christopher Hikaru Nakamura, a five-time U.S. Chess Champion and American chess grandmaster, achieved the grandmaster title at an impressively young
          age of 15, making him the youngest American to earn the title at that time. Nakamura's achievements includes earning team gold and two team bronze
          medals for the United States at five Chess Olympiads, and reigning as the World Fischer Random Chess Champion. With a peak rating of 2816, Nakamura is
          the tenth-highest rated player in history..
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2018, Nakamura made his debut on Twitch as a streamer and has gained immense popularity. On his channel, "GMHikaru," he plays speed chess games and
          reviews his tournament games. He is known for playing games using "joke openings," such as the Bongcloud Attack, the Jerome Gambit, and the Botez
          Gambit. Despite his success as a professional chess player, Nakamura has declared that he prioritizes his streaming career over his chess playing
          career.
